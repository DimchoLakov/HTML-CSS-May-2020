    <h1>Elephant</h1>
    <p>The <b>elephants</b> are the large mammals forming the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae">Proboscidea</a>. Three species are currently recognised: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant">African
                            forest elephant</a> (<i>L. cyclotis</i>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant">sub-Saharan
                            Africa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South
                            Asia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast
                            Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomphothere">mastodons</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis">proboscis</a>), used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping
        objects. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor">incisors</a> grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column">pillar</a>-like
        legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
    </p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna">marshes</a>. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species">keystone
                            species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion">tigers</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena" ). Elephants have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society">fissionâ€“fusion
                            society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The
        groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy">matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.
    </p>
    <p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone">dominance</a>        and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants
        use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound">seismic communication</a> over long distances. Elephant

    </p>
    <p>The second radiation was represented by the emergence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomphothere"><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar17-41">[41]</a></sup> which likely evolved from <i>Eritreum</i><sup>Platybelodon</a></i>.
        <sup  >[41]</a></sup> The third radiation started in the late Miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres.<sup><a

        while <i>Mammuthus</i> and <i>Elephas</i> diverged later during the early Pliocene. <i>Loxodonta</i> remained in Africa while <i>Mammuthus</i> and

Only when <i>Elephas</i> disappeared from Africa did <i>Loxodonta</i>        become dominant once again, this time in the form of the modern species. <i>Elephas</i> diversified into new species in Asia, such as <i>E.&nbsp;hysudricus</i> and <i>E.&nbsp;platycephus</i>;

        at the shoulder and 2,700&nbsp;kg (6,000&nbsp;lb). African forest elephants are the smallest species, usually being around 2.20&nbsp;m (7.22&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder and 2,000&nbsp;kg (4,400&nbsp;lb). Male African elephants are typically
        23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females.<sup>[62]</a></sup> The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while
        Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.<sup>[63]</a></sup>

    <p>An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction.

    <p>Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)">capillaries</a>. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs
        when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have
        the largest ear flaps.<sup>[70]</a></sup>

    <p>Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor">molars</a>. Unlike most mammals, which
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_development">polyphyodonts</a> that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones
        emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years
        old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9â€“15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18â€“28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final)
        set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.<sup>[76]</a></sup>

    <p>The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_teeth">milk
                            teeth</a> at 6â€“12 months of age and grow continuously at about 17&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;in) a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel">pulp</a> and some have nerves stretching
        to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking
        or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.

                            or left-handed</a>, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both
        males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft),<sup><a

    </p>
    <p>In the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all.<sup>[80]</a></sup> Asian males can have tusks as long as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was 3.02&nbsp;m

    <p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in) thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus">anus</a>, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants
        typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or
        reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ">genitals</a>        and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.

    <p>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet">mud

        crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-area-to-volume_ratio">surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They
        have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.<sup><a

    <p>To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone">haematopoiesis</a>.
        <sup>[88]</a></sup> Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front.
        <sup>[89]</a></sup> Since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy.

Spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals.<sup>[93]</a></sup>        During locomotion, the cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving.<sup><a

    <p>The brain of an elephant weighs 4.5â€“5.5&nbsp;kg (10â€“12&nbsp;lb) compared to 1.6&nbsp;kg (4&nbsp;lb) for a human brain. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30â€“40% of

        <sup>[95]</a></sup> When standing, the elephant's heart beats approximately 30 times per minute. Unlike many other animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down.<sup>[96]</a></sup> The blood vessels

    <p>The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In the case of elephants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amboseli_National_Park">Amboseli
                            National Park</a>, Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups. These are typically made
        of two family groups,<sup>[116]</a></sup> which may be closely related due to previously being part of the same family group which split after becoming too large for the available resources.<sup><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these
        clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral" subpopulations.
        <sup>[116]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India,
        elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known
        as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group. Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three
        offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.<sup>[116]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families
        when they are 14â€“15. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest
        consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals.<sup>[121]</a></sup> These elephants can be quite sociable when not competing
        for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships.
        <sup>dominance
                            hierarchy</a> exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily. Dominance depends on the age, size and sexual condition,<sup  ><a

        more experienced males,
        <sup>[122]</a></sup> whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting "deviant" behaviour.

    <h4></h4>

    <p>Adult males enter a state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone">musth</a>. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli,
        bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25â€“35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (Januaryâ€“May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (Juneâ€“December). The main
        characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporin">temporal
                            gland</a> that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_sheath">sheath</a>, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking,
        rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.<sup>[124]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonistic_behaviour">agonistic</a> encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth
        individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters
        typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.<sup>[124]</a></sup>

    <p>Bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males.<sup>[130]</a></sup> Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, particularly older

        <sup>[131]</a></sup> Thus these bulls have more reproductive success.<sup><a

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation">Gestation</a> in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. Births tend to take place during the wet season.
        <sup><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup> Calves are born 85&nbsp;cm (33&nbsp;in) tall and weigh around 120&nbsp;kg (260&nbsp;lb).<sup>[140]</a></sup>
        <sup>[142]</a></sup> A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant
        of other herd members near her young. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloparenting">Alloparenting</a> â€“ where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother â€“ takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve
        years old.
        <sup>[133]</a></sup> When a predator is near, the family group gathers together with the calves in the centre.
        <sup>[143]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it
        to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly
        through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.<sup>[142]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves
        continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and
        feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2â€“4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches
        three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.<sup><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar126-142">[142]</a></sup>

    <p>Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger
        ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is especially important for motherâ€“calf
        communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it
        wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.<sup><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust
        and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a
        challenge will position their ears in a V shape.<sup>[148]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Elephants produce several sounds, usually through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx">modified</a> by the trunk.
        <sup>[149]</a></sup> Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression.<sup><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_(noise)">[149]</a></sup> in both Asian and African elephants. For Asian elephants, these calls have
        a frequency of 14â€“24&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Payne-152">[152]</a></sup> For African elephants, calls range from 15â€“35&nbsp;Hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117&nbsp;dB, allowing communication for
        many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi).<sup>[153]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact calls are soft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"
            soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by
            the "female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the
            "mating pandemonium".<sup>[151]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Elephants are known to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_communication">communicate
                            with seismics</a>, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting
        seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous
        nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal">ear canal</a> constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.<sup>[154]</a></sup>        Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.<sup>[155]</a></sup> When detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger
        from predators, elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. Seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to 32&nbsp;km (20&nbsp;mi) while those from vocalisations travel 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi).<sup>[156]</a></sup>

        <sup>[165]</a></sup> The Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatry">sympatric</a> terrestrial mammals, they are
        the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements.
        Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation.<sup><a

    <p>Elephants have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal">working
                            animals</a> since at least the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">[177]</a></sup> and continue to be used in modern times. There were 13,000â€“16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000.
        These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10â€“20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life.<sup>traditionally
                            captured with traps and lassos</a>, but since 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative"  ><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Individuals of the Asian species have been often trained as working animals. Asian elephants perform tasks such as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park">national
                            parks</a>, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions.<sup>[180]</a></sup> They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation
        and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands.<sup>[178]</a></sup> Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and semi-starved until the condition
        passes.
        <sup>[181]</a></sup> In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals_Act,1960">The Prevention of
                            Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960</a>.<sup>[182]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>In both Myanmar and Thailand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation">deforestation</a> and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves
        as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.<sup>[183]</a></sup>
        <sup>[184]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>The practice of working elephants has also been attempted in Africa. The taming of African elephants in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Congo">Belgian
                            Congo</a> began by decree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium">[185]</a></sup>

    <p>Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an
        enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.<sup>[186]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>One of the earliest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata"
                                
             >Magadha
                            Kingdom</a> (which began in the 6th century BC), elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively; 3,000 of them were used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanda_Empire"
            >Mauryan army</a> (between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC). The <i><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra" >Arthashastra</a></i> (written around 300 BC) advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed
        them.
        <sup>[188]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>In his 326 B.C. Indian campaign, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</a> confronted elephants for the first time, and suffered heavy casualties. Among the reasons for the refusal of the rank-and-file Macedonian
        soldiers to continue the Indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in India.<sup>Ptolemy</a>, who was one of Alexander's
        generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus" >Ptolemy
                            II</a> (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia" >Nubia</a>. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and
        North Africa throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity" >Alps</a> during his war with the Romans and reached the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_Valley" >Po
                            Valley</a> in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.<sup  >[186]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Overall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked. With time, strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used
        by Romans and Parthians.<sup>[189]</a></sup>

    <p>Elephants were historically kept for display in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menagerie">Ancient Egypt</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephants_in_ancient_China">modern
                            era</a>, elephants have traditionally been a major part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo">circuses</a> around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant
        was probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo">[190]</a></sup> These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were
        always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued.
        Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.<sup>[191]</a></sup> As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest
        captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.<sup><a

    </p>
    <p>Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species.
        Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress.<sup>stereotypical behaviours</a> in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.
        <sup  >[193]</a></sup> Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.
        <sup>[194]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>The use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States">Humane Society of the United States</a> has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals.<sup><a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup> In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Jeffrey_Feld">bull

        on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any of these practices harm elephants.<sup>[196]</a></sup> Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment.

    <p>Elephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans.
        <sup>[199]</a></sup> In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive.<sup>[200]</a></sup>
        <sup>[201]</a></sup> In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand">Assam</a>,
        239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.<sup>[199]</a></sup> Local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks, although officials have disputed this explanation.<sup><a

        some were even given hooves. Elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture" >Gothic</a> churches. As more elephants began to be sent to
