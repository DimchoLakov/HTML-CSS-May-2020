    <p>One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Karanovo culture</a>, which dates back to 6,500 BC.

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%9378)">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a> resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which
        led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria">democracy</a> and a market-based economy.

        lives mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Bulgaria">27 provinces</a>, and the country has suffered significant demographic decline since the late 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>Bulgaria is a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">European Single Market</a> and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture.
